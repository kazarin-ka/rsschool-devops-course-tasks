# TODO: Future Improvements

## Planned Enhancements

1. **Refactor GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Break down the GitHub Actions workflow configuration into multiple files to improve maintainability and reduce code duplication (DRY principle).
     - Separate workflows for checking, planning, and applying Terraform changes.
     - Use reusable workflows to centralize common actions like setting up Terraform.

2. **Enhance IAM Configuration**
   - Add support for IAM groups and roles to extend the identity and access management system.
     - Define roles with specific permissions.
     - Organize users into groups for better access control and management.

3**Extend Workflow Notifications**
   - Add notifications for workflow failures and successes.
     - Integrate Slack or email notifications for better visibility of the CI/CD pipeline status.
     - Add error handling and retry logic in case of transient failures during workflow execution.

4**Implement Terraform Module Structure**
   - Refactor Terraform projects into reusable modules.
     - Create shared modules for S3, DynamoDB, and IAM roles to minimize repetition.
     - Use versioned modules for better control of infrastructure changes.

5**Enhance Testing and Validation**
   - Add unit and integration tests for Terraform configurations.
     - Implement static analysis tools like `tflint` and `terraform validate` in the CI pipeline.
     - Use `terratest` for automated infrastructure testing.

6**Documentation Improvements**
   - Expand the documentation to include detailed instructions for running, testing, and maintaining the Terraform infrastructure.
     - Add examples for running Terraform commands locally.
     - Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues during deployment.
